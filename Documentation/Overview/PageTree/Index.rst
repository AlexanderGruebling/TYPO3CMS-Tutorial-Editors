Page Tree
^^^^^^^^^

|img-6| Figure 3

In the page tree you will see different icons:

#. This is a  **standard** page

#. This page is a  **shortcut** , that means, if you visit this page in
   the frontend you will be redirected to a different page.

#. This page is  **not visible** in the frontend. It has  **Hide Page**
   enabled in the page properties.

#. This one is of the type  **not in menu** . It has  **Hide in Menu**
   enabled in the page properties.

#. This is not so much a page but rather a  **folder** , they are used to
   store all kinds of items, for example news, newsletters, guest book
   entries, etc.

#. Clicking on the plus sign expands the directory tree. Clicking on the
   minus sign contracts the directory tree.

#. If you created a page and it doesn't appear in the page tree, try
   reloading it.

Note that it makes a difference if you click on the icon or on the
name of the page. Clicking on the icon will produce a menu with page
specific options, while clicking on the name of the page will load the
page in the work area.
