Menu
^^^^

The menu has categories with several modules. In Figure 2 you can see
the categories  **Web, File, User tools, Admin tools** and  **Help**
and for example the modules  **Page, View, Versioning, Filelist** plus
some others and some help modules. The categories and modules
available to you depend on how the administrator has setup your
account.

The most used category is  **Web** and the therein contained module
**Page** . It allows you to create and edit webpages, manage different
languages and columns of content per page.

The  **View** module shows the frontend look of the page currently
selected in the Page Tree.

The  **List** module provides low level access to database-records
appearing on a page.

The  **Versioning** module shows versioning and workspace.

Depending on your settings there might be a  **User** category with a
**Task Center** and / or a  **Setup** option.

This tutorial does not cover versioning, workspace, user, task center,
or setup.

Also quite important is the  **Filelist** module. It is used to store
all kinds of files like pictures, PDFs, etc. on the server.

All modules are explained in the  **About modules** module in the help
category. Please note that the categories can be folded using the
little + / - buttons next to the name.
