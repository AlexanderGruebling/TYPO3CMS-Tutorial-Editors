Working with Languages
----------------------

If your site is available in multiple languages, you want to have
different translations of the same page. Here is what you need to do:

In the top part of the  **Page module** , you have a drop-down box,
where you select the  **Languages** option, as seen in Figure 21.

If you want to translate an existing page you will can click the
button  **Make new translation of this page** [1] with a drop-down
menu of the available languages (see Figure 22). Choose the one you
want, then enter the new translation of the page name in the field
**Pagetitle** and save.

Now you can  **copy the content of the page in the source language**
to the new language [2]. This is quite useful, if you have images
which you would like to see in the version of the new language as
well.

You can also  **create an entirely new version** of the page.

If this two column mode is a little confusing, you can go back to the
old view of the work area by selecting  **Columns** in the dropdown
menu, where you previously selected Languages.

Note that you can now switch between the different translations of the
page with another drop-down menu below the one you just used.
