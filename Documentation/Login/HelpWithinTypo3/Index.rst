Help within TYPO3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we dive further into using TYPO3, I would like to make clear
again that even though this tutorial covers the basic features, there
are a lot more. Here's where you can learn more directly from within
your website:

- A very short description of buttons or functions appears if you hover
  with your mouse pointer over it.

- A lot of times you will see a question mark next to an element.
  Hovering over it will pop up a little help window about the item or
  function it is next to. |img-4|

- For a more extensive description use the  **manual** module in the
  help category in the menu.
