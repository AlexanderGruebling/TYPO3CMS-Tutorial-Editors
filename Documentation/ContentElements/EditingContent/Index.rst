Editing Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The work area for editing content and for creating content is actually
the same. The only difference is that the form is already filled when
you edit an existing element. In this section you will find a
description of the different parts of the working area when working
with a  **text with image** content element. This covers both the
**text** and the  **images** content elements.

|img-12| Figure 9

The top area contains the header of the element ([1] in Figure 9), as
well as the type [2], which you can change. Be aware that changing a
text with image element to a text element will cause it to lose all
pictures.

To save changes you made to the element use the floppy disk icon [3].
If you want to save changes and see them in the frontend use the
floppy disk with the magnifying glass [4]. It will save the changes
and pop up a window displaying the page you're working on. Disable
pop-up-blockers for this site!

Icon [5] will save the changes and close the content element. You will
be brought back to the work area of the page module.

Icon [6] will go back to the work area of the page module without
saving the changes.

The trash can [7] will delete the current content element.

The last icon with a small arrow [8] will undo the last saved change
made to this content element.
