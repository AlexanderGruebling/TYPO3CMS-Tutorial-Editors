Working with Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|img-15| Most times you work with images either in the "text with image" or the
"images only" content element. These cases are covered here. For
working with images it can be helpful to activate the option  **Show
secondary options** at the bottom of the page with the edit form.

Figure 12

#. A  **list of images** currently visible on the page.

#. Select an image on the left and  **change the order** with these
   arrows.

#. Select an image on the left and  **remove from the list.**

#. To  **add an image from the filelist** on the server, use this folder
   button. For more information on the filelist see the following
   section.

#. To  **directly upload an image** to use it only in this content
   element use this field.

#. **Place the images** relatively to the text.

#. Set a specific  **width and / or height** for all images in this
   element.

#. Turn the images into a  **link.**

#. Make the  **fullscreen size** of an image available.

#. Set the  **image quality.**

#. If you want to have a  **caption for an image** put it in here. For
   multiple images put each caption in one line.

You will also see a text area for  **Alternative Text** . It is
generally a good idea to write a couple of words describing each
picture in one line each. This is especially important for
accessibility requirements (for example, Section 508 compliance in the
US).
