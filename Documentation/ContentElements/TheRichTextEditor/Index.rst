The Rich Text Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The editor is pretty much self explanatory, you have probably worked
with similar word processing software before. Depending on how the
site was set up, the buttons available to you will vary. Here's an
example:

Common  **Rich Text Editor** (RTE) formatting options include:

#. **bold** and  *italic* writing

#. :sup:`super` and :sub:`sub` script

#. numbered and unordered lists

#. indentation of the paragraph

#. inserting special characters

#. creation of a hyperlink (only available, if text is selected), see
   section below

#. inserting a table

#. search and replace

#. show HTML source (only helpful if you know html)

#. remove unwanted formatting, for example if you copy and paste from MS
   Word or from another website

#. undo / redo

#. toggle borders (for tables)


Creating a Link
"""""""""""""""

Once you have selected a word or more in the rich text editor and
clicked on the  **Link** icon, you have the following options:

#. Link to a  **page within your website** , just click on the name

#. Link to a  **file** from the module filelist, more about files later
   on

#. Link to  **another website** , just enter the websites address (URL)
   into the appropriate field and set the link

#. Link to an  **email-address** , just enter in the right field and set
   link

If you have selected an existing link, you can use the Link icon to
edit the link. With the leftmost option,  **Remove Link** , you can
remove the link.
