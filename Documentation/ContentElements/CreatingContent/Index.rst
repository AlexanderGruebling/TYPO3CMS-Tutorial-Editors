Creating Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have clicked to create a new content element, you will see a
page with various content types available for selection (Figure 8).
Note that the content type selections available to you are dependent
on the features you have installed in your TYPO3 system.

In this image you can then select [1] which type of content you want
to have and then [2] where on the page it should appear (use the small
grey arrow). The second option is only visible if you haven't already
specified where you want to have it. In other words, to see this
position selection, you must use the  **new content** icon at the top
of the page (Figure 6, Item 4).

Then you can edit the new content.
