Working with Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will now discuss the work area of the page module, where most of
the work is usually done. Don't be scared by the many icons and
buttons, as they are somewhat redundant. Use the mouse to point and
hover (do not click) over any icon to see a little help text appear.
At first we will discuss working with content, later we will talk
about how to work with pages.

Figure 5 shows the work area of the page module after clicking on the
name of a page in the page tree. You can see three  **content
elements** in the column called  *normal* .

The first and the third one are of the type  **text** [1 and 3], the
second one is of the type  **text with image** [2]. We'll learn more
about different content types later on, let's first see what the
buttons are about:

|img-9| Figure 6

#. This icon represents the  **content element** as a whole. Each content
   type has a different icon. Clicking on it pops up a menu with content
   element specific options.

#. Clicking on the pen lets you  **edit** this element.

#. Use one of these icons to  **create a new content element** (also
   called a record) after an existing content element or at the beginning
   of a column.

#. This icon also lets you  **create a new content element** , but here
   you can choose where you want to put it out of a list of all elements
   on the page.

#. If you have more than one element in a column, you can  **move** them
   around using these arrows.

#. To  **hide** or  **unhide** an element use the light bulb. Notice how
   the main icon of the the third element also shows that it is hidden.
   The page icons do the same for pages.

#. To  **see hidden elements** at all, you must check this option.

#. Finally, to  **remove** an element as a whole you use the garbage can.

In TYPO3 version 4.2 the general options are a bit shuffled around as
you can see in Figure 7, but still have the same meaning as above:
