Creating Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding a new page can be done in two ways.

First make sure that you currently are in a module inside the category
Web (e.g. in the page module).


First way of adding a new Page
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Click on any  **page icon** |img-20| in the page tree.

Then from the drop down menu select  **New.**

|img-21| |img-22| Now you will see the screen below in the work area:

Figure 16

Clicking on any subitem of  **Create a new page** will immediately
bring up the  **New page** information. Depending upon your selection
you will create a page inside the current one (a subpage), after the
current one (a sibling) or you get a wizard in which you can select
the position of the page.


Second way of adding a new Page
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Open the  **page** module.

Click on any  **name of a page** in the page tree.

The screen below will open in the work area:

|img-23| Figure 17

Next click on the button  **New page** .

|img-24| You will see the  **New record** screen.

Now  **select where you want to add the page** in the page tree of
your website. (If you place it somewhere by mistake you can always
move it with the move page option or by simply dragging it in the page
tree later.)

Once you have decided where to place your new page, click on the
little page icon with the arrow pointing to it |img-25| and your page
will be inserted at this point.

|img-27| Once you have created a page, the top part of the page view provides
options as shown in Figure 19.

#. **Edit page properties** opens work area with some page specific
   options. For example you can choose to Hide/Unhide the page or you can
   enter a Navigation title so that the page has a different title in the
   menu than in the page header.

#. **Move page** lets you move the page. As you can see, you often can
   achieve the same thing by different means.

#. To create a  **New page** use this button. Alternatively you can also
   use the one from the context menu. By default, the new page is hidden,
   so that you can create the content of the page before making it
   publicly available. Don't forget to Save the new page by using one of
   the floppy disk icons!
