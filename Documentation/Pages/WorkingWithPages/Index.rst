Working with Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have already seen the page tree, now you will learn how pages are
created, moved around, hidden and deleted. Here is the context menu
which you get when you click on the icon of a page:

The first three options are the ones which you are likely to use
commonly:

**Show** opens the page in the View module (like your frontend view).

**Edit** opens it in the Page module.

**New** will let you create new content on that page or let you create
a new page.

The other options are not used that often:

**Info** is not useful for editors.

**Copy** will, surprise, copy the entire page. It will be stored in
the TYPO3 clipboard, which is quite similar to the copy and paste you
know from the operating system of your computer.

**Cut** will make it possible to move the page to a different place.

Once the page has been copied or cut, the pop up menu of a different
page will additionally have the following two entries:

|img-18| **Paste into** will put the page inside the page you clicked on, so
that it will appear as a child of that page in the page tree.

**Paste after** will put it on the same level of the page tree
hierarchy.

We will neither discuss  **Versioning** here, nor  **Send to
review/pub** .

The  **More options...** field will open yet another menu, with an
interesting option called  **Move page** .

Let me repeat that. Clicking on the icon of a page [1] will pop up a
menu and selecting More Options [2] will pop up another menu. Move
page [3] lets you select in the work area where the page should be
moved, by clicking on one of the grey arrows [4].

You can also move files and folders around easily via drag and drop.
You can move a page by dragging it with the mouse. If you drop it at
another page, you will get a popup window in which you can decide if
you want to copy or move the page after or inside the page where you
have dropped the other one. Easy, isn't it?

The  **Hide** option makes the page unreachable in the frontend.

The  **Delete** option deletes the page altogether.
